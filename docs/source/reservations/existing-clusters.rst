Deploy SkyPilot on existing infrastructure
==========================================

This page will help you deploy SkyPilot on your existing infrastructure - whether it's on-premises machines or reserved instances on a cloud provider.

Given a list of IP addresses and SSH keys, the ``deploy.sh`` script will install necessary
dependencies on the remote machines and configure SkyPilot to run jobs and services on the cluster.

Behind the scenes, the script deploys a lightweight Kubernetes cluster on the remote machines using `k3s <https://k3s.io/>`_.
Note that no Kubernetes knowledge is required - SkyPilot abstracts away the complexity of Kubernetes and provides a simple interface to run your jobs and services.

Prerequisites
-------------

**Local machine (typically your laptop):**

* `kubectl <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/>`_
* `SkyPilot <https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html>`_

**Remote machines (your cluster, optionally with GPUs):**

* Debian-based OS (tested on Debian 11)
* SSH access with key-based authentication
  * All machines must use the same SSH key and username
* Port 6443 must be accessible on the head node from your local machine

Deployment steps
----------------

1. Create ``ips.txt`` with the IP addresses of your machines with one IP per line (like a MPI hostfile).
   The first node will be used as the head node. Here is an example ``ips.txt`` file:

   .. code-block:: text

      192.168.1.1
      192.168.1.2
      192.168.1.3

2. Get the deployment script:

   .. code-block:: bash

      wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skypilot-org/skypilot/main/examples/onprem_deployment/deploy.sh
      chmod +x deploy.sh

2. Run ``./deploy.sh`` and pass the ``ips.txt`` file, SSH username, and SSH keys as arguments:

   .. code-block:: bash

      chmod +x deploy.sh
      IP_FILE=ips.txt
      USERNAME=username
      SSH_KEY=path/to/ssh/key
      ./deploy.sh $IP_FILE $USERNAME $SSH_KEY

3. The script will deploy a Kubernetes cluster on the remote machines, setup GPU support, configure Kubernetes credentials on your local machine, and set up SkyPilot to operate with the new cluster.

   At the end, you should see a message like this:

   .. code-block:: text

      âœ” SkyPilot configured successfully.
      ==== ðŸŽ‰ Kubernetes cluster deployment completed successfully ðŸŽ‰ ====

4. To verify that the cluster is running, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sky check kubernetes

   You can now use SkyPilot to launch your development clusters and training jobs on your own infrastructure.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sky show-gpus --cloud kubernetes
      Kubernetes GPUs
      GPU   QTY_PER_NODE  TOTAL_GPUS  TOTAL_FREE_GPUS
      L4    1, 2, 4       12          2
      H100  1, 2, 4, 8    16          12
      Kubernetes per node GPU availability
      NODE_NAME                  GPU_NAME  TOTAL_GPUS  FREE_GPUS
      my-cluster-0               L4        4           2
      my-cluster-1               L4        4           0
      my-cluster-2               L4        2           0
      my-cluster-3               L4        2           0
      my-cluster-4               H100      8           8
      my-cluster-5               H100      8           4

   You can optionally use ``kubectl`` to interact with the cluster.

5. To teardown the Kubernetes cluster and clean up, use the ``--cleanup`` flag:

   .. code-block:: bash

      IP_FILE=ips.txt
      USERNAME=username
      SSH_KEY=path/to/ssh/key
      ./deploy.sh $IP_FILE $USERNAME $SSH_KEY --cleanup

   This will stop all Kubernetes services on the remote machines.
